A simple digital envelope budgeting tool

## Description
*Side Note: It has been a while since I last modified this project due to job changes and time flucuations which consequentally the project has yet to be completed*

I love the envelope budgeting system as it has helped me limit spending and tracking where my money goes via categorizations. So, this is an attempt to build my own verison of YNAB (You Need A Budget) to sharpen my Laravel skills and to free up a subscription. It's going to start off very simple by recording transactions and creating "envelopes" but as time progresses, its the hope to become more advanced and streamlined to help save time (who's got the time to visit every financial accound, search previous statements, download, and then import?)
